/*Add
Add two vectors together using the formula:
If A = (ai) vector of length n and B = (bi) is vector of length n, then the sum A + B is also
a vector of length n such that A + B = (ai + bi)
The definition of vector addition indicates an element-by-element addition. The
elements of vector A are added to the exact corresponding elements of vector B. To add
A and B they must be the same dimensions.

/*Dot Product
The dot product results in a scalar value using the following formula:
If A = (ai) vector of length n and B = (bi) is vector of length n, then the dot product A · B
is a scalar such that A · B = a1b1 + a2b2 + ... + anbn
The definition of dot product indicates an element-by-element multiplication. The
elements of vector A are multiplied by the exact corresponding elements of vector B
and all results are added together.

/*Cross Product
The cross-product results in a vector that is perpendicular to each of the source vectors
A and B. A cross product must be performed on vectors of 3 dimensions.
If A = (a1, a2, a3) and B = (b1, b2, b3), then the cross product A x B is a vector such that A x
B = (c1, c2, c3) where:
c1 = a2 * b3 - a3 * b2
c2 = a3 * b1 - a1 * b3
c3 = a1 * b2 - a2 * b1
